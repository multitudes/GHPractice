# GHPractice

To practice the Sean Allen tutorial I divided the repository in different branches going through the different stage of the project.
**The first branch is therefore empty and it builds up from there**

GetFollowers is a typical take home project iOS app created during the Sean Allen's intermediate iOS tutorial ['Take Home Project'](https://seanallen.teachable.com/courses/enrolled/681906). 

Using the GitHub API, it is built 100% with programmatic UI without storyboards. It displays the followers of an user, allowing to save favorites and visit the profile website of selected users.
